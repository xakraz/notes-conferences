## Load traffic shedding

### 1 - Timeline

* 2009 - 3 Main Gmail outages
* 2010 - 1st Load sheding implementation
* 2013 - Generaliszation



### 2 - Threats

* Single Task overload
  - Causing cascading failure

* Cluster overload

* Whole Service overload



### 3 - Principles

#### Sustain peak performance

> Accept you will throw erros

* Task should have a "normal" capacity, what ever the traffic it receives
*


#### Isolation

#### Criticality

+ QOS of requests (Not all requests are born equals)
  * Batch, Async, Sheddable, Critical


#### Cost based

QPS is not enought to measure cost
-> transition to 'Cost-per-second'

> Example
> --
>
> Same query != Cost
>
> * 1 user with 1 friend -> 1 Q = 0.1
> * 1 user with 10 0000 friends -> Q is much eavier
>


#### Retries

* Always implement retries logici

Warning: poor retry logic



### 4 - Techniques

Client-side
* Efficient BUT
* What if not every client implement the stuff, you still get overloaded

Server-side
* The most efficient to mitigate load


Notes:
- Event loop latency monitor (`Twisted` in python)
- Resources utilizations
- Rate limiting ...

-> you can then "compose" task load tracker with all these metrics



### 5 - Solutions

Haproxy
- Max-in-flight-requests
- Health-checking
- Circuit-breaker

+ Others L4 proxies

> Need some tunning,


Software:
* Akka (Connection wrappers)


https://github.com/juju/ratelimit
- Token based implementation
- Client / Server side
- Go based


https://lyft.github.io/envoy
- "Let me wrapp it for you" category
- HTTP/2 + GRPC interface
- Proxy things
- Good for "legacy" transition

https://linked.io
- Same principle that Envoy
- Can be deployed as an "agent"



### 6 - Impacts on Operations

#### Batch handling

### Enaabling application-level and business decisions

Provision below peak traffic & drop non-priority traffic

-> Allows to control "problems" and not be in an emergency situation
