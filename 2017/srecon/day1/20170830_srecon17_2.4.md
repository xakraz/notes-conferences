## Anycast is not loadbalancing

### 1 - Start the story

How do you scale ?
* Start with 1 Server
* More servers
* Tell clients about new servers ?



### 2 - What is AnyCast ?

What
- Network magic
- Configure the same IP on multiple devices
- Let the "netwrk" decide wich server receive the request

Pros:
- Simple client config
- Simple horizontal scaling
- Low dependency

Good for:
- Staless app
- "Simple" HA



### 3 - Catch ?

NOT lbs
- no control where is the request going
- no way to "stop accepting new request" BUT "keep serving existing"
- no traffic shapping


Monitoring ?
- Probe are basics
- Not easy to know from wich server the issue comes from
- May fall in a case were no backend is the closest for the Anycast probe ...


Failure modes
- By default, no check of pool member ships
- No nothion on Pool



### 4 - Don't believe in Magic

Anycast is usefull

But
- it is load DISTRIBUTION
