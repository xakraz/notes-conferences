## Becomming a Tech Lead

### Team interest

It's all about Team execution
* Help the team to meet its goals, objectives,
* Help the team to be on the same page

-> It's primarily a social role



### Communication

TLs: People and communication
* alias for "goes to meeting" :)
* Influence, guidance, sponsorship, delegation
* Share and spread the knowledge



### Activity

TLs time
* essential:
  - Tech capability
  - judgment
* Less important
  - accomplishment

-> 40-60% of time is communication



### Beeing TL is hard

* Delegate high impact / "fun" and "intersting" work
* Conince people to to things in a certain way is hard

-> You are responible for your team impact, not only yourself any more



### TLs / Manager

Complementary and NOT overlapping

Manager (PO): Focus on business needs

-> Where = Manager
-> How = TL



### How to use TLs

* Source of information
  - Provide informations
  - OR redirect to the right people
* Decision making
* Advocate & Amplifier


=> Key result: The team move forward
