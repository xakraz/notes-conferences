#### 1 - Architecture

Today there are **plenty tools to deploy k8s**
* Tectonic installer
* kargo
* kops
* terraform


#### 2 - Failure in HA

##### Master nodes HA

"Control plane" is a classic web app
* API Server
* Controller
* ...
-> kube in kube ?

Etcd
* is kind of "special"
* is a DB, statefull, on disk state is uniq
* clustered

=> `etcd-operator`
* Observe
* Decide
* Act

> Etcd runs as a Pod
> Scheduled on Masters thanks to labels and afinity
> k8s has been setup to allow scheduling of some services on the masters


API server
* Run N API servers (Same that ectd servers by example)
* Macth ECTD / API server failure domains
* Maintain a load balancer

> Risk if API downtime:
> RO: No new workloads
> Down: Visibility


Scheduler and Controller
* Statefull but backed by API server
* Leader elected -> you can run nore than 1
* Use anti-afinity to avoid 2 instances on the same node

> In case of scheduler failure
> -> You have to re-launch manually 1 scheduler Pod


DNS
* ...

##### Interesing concepts

* Labels
* Failure domains
* AntiAfinity
* `-o jsonpath` query


#### 3 - Monitoring

Thanks to prometheus
* Nodes
* ControlPlane: etcd key metrics
* ...


#### 4 - Backup and Recovery

-> See github nodes


#### 5 - Upgrade

Self hosted architecture shine for that purpose


#### 6 - Management nodes
Use standard tools like terraform or
