## 3 - Keynotes - End of the day

### 3.1 - What makes the community happy

k8s:
* Since day 1 Open Source
* Backed by Google engineers
* Designed to run anywhere
* Community has the opportunity to drive the project roadmap (SIGs)

Contributions:
* 1 year ago: 67% was Google
* Today: Google backed to 42%

Did Google drop k8s ?
-> Nope
-> More and more Google's engineers working on it (GKE)
BUT more and more contributors

OpenStandards:
* For user benefits
* Composable systems
* Open defined interfaces
  + CNI
  + OCI
  + CSI (storage)
  + OpenServiceBrocker API

Velocity / Stability
* Deals with SIGs projects integrations
* Ease contributors onboarding


### 3.2 - CoreOS / Tectonic / Helm

Lightning talk / demo about App-registry


### 3.3 - Philips Hue - Powered by k8s

### 3.4 - Workload colocation on k8s

### 3.5 - Helm

OPS Evolutions
* SSH and do manual things
* CFG mgnt
* Containers + k8s

Dev point of views
* More and more difficult
* From 1 monolith to plenty of micro services
* Plenty of tools to lean
  + Minikube on local machine
  + kubectl
  + Build my App
  + Build my Container
  + Understand the k8s concepts
  + Write my `deployment.yml`

=> We need a fast and easy wayt to distribute an App: Helm


### 3.6 - Closing of the day
