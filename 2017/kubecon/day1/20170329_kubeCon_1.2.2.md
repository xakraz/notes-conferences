### 2.2 - Reworking your teams for k8s (@Yahoo)

#### Starting point

* Very large on-prem server infra
* Java, Node, many more
* Minimal containerization
* Some "internal cloud"
* "Traditionnal" ops


#### Yahoo

* Internet player for a long time
* Big player in the industry
* Contributer
* Hadoop
* NodeJS
* ...

but NO CLOUD yet ...


#### Path Forward

##### Context:

Pod (Yahoo style):
* Apps +
* Auth sidecar
* Logging sidecar
* Metrics sidecar

##### Questions

* Is it worth it ?
* Do we have the skillset to manage it ?
* How much work will it be to adapt my systems ?
* Is it ready for "mass market" ?

##### Tech Challenges

* Does the App start fast enough to live under orchestration ?
* Are there IP constraints ?
* Limit Cluster access but still make debugging easy ?


#### How to

Rule 1: Know thyself
* Which App can be moved first
* Resources needs
* Availability needs

Rule2: Build a Team
* Practical on-call experience
  + Everyone: Team Leads, Fronts, back, SRE, ...
* Key experts literature
  + Monitoring
  + Logging
* Brown Bag learning
  + Build an internal community


#### Bumps in the road

* Packages management issues
* OS compatibility
* Set sane DEFAULTS

=> Tune for real world use cases
