# 1 - Why

Yet an other LB ?
- Nginx, Varnish, Apache, HAporyx, Traeffic, ...

@Ebay
* `Consul` integration
* Time to write 1 dedicated



# 2 - Routing in micro services

1 URL Path
1 Service

BUT:
* Highly dynamic / Short life instances
* Dynamic PORT allocation



# 3 - Fabio insight

## 3.1 - Consul integration

* Use service-name
* Use TAGS as `Path` for routing table

`urlprefix-PATH`


## 3.2 - Config language

Can overwrite Fabio dynamic config manually
- DSL (Human readable)

Routing table
- `route add SERVICE_NAME PATH DESTINATION:PORT`
- `route dell SERVICE_NAME PATH DESTINATION:PORT`

Traffic shapping
- `route weight`



# 4 - Advantages

Easy:

- Provisionning service
-> Registering automatically
-> DONE

- Need manual changes sometime
-> DONE

- Works everywhere
-> Cloud
-> Laptop
-> HW

- Refactoring

# 8 - FAQ

## 8.1 - HTTP 2.0 ?

Not yet


## 8.2 - A/B testing with Traffic Shapping ?

We use it to switch from Java -> Go

BUT
- No reall tips on HOW to measure stuff with Fabio
- Too much "glue"


## 8.3 - Fabio / Traeffic

Traeffic
- feature rich

But at the time I though about OpenSourcing Fabio, was not so advanced
