Keynote: Runway


# 1 - Intro

## Distributed systems are Hard

* Concurrency + Delays
* Failures
* Lots of events (expected or not)

=> Lack of visibility and debugging


## Raft - Background

* Leader election
* Logs replicated to followers

=> Complex setup and situations


## Fixing Bugs

* Many techniques for Technical bugs
* Nothing for DESIGN bug


## Design Phase



# 2 - Runway

## Overview

1. Submit a Model (according to Specs)
2. Creates
  - A simuator
  - Model checker
3. Execute the simulation
4. Creates
  - Visualization
  - Data


## Demo


## Building a Model

Model:
* Spec (New kind of language)
* View (JS, SVG, ..)

### Spec

* Spec IS code


* Starting State
* transitional rules
* invariants



# 3 - Summary

* Modeling help to focus on concepts
* Runway: 1 Tool to help design distributed systems
