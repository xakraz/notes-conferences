## Scriptable LoadBalancer

### 1 - Middleware LB

#### Overview

* Classic LBs
* Custom LBs (Fb, Google, Fastly, Cloudlfare)

-> In between: "Scriptable loadbalancer"


#### Scriptable LBs

* nginScript: Nginx.com properitary lanagage
* OpenResty (Nginx + Lua)
* Haproxy + lua (since recently)


#### Why Scriptable LBs

Begining
* WebServer
* AppServer
* DBServer

Then:
* DB shards

Then:
* MultiDCs

-> Issue: WAN access between AppServer -> DB Shard in an other DC ...


=> Went with Nginx +lua

+ Implemented dynamic config with ZK



### 2 - Edge cache servers



### 3 - Getting Clever

Using `ECMP`



### 4 - Tips / take away

Deterministric config
- Remove Config from the cfg Mgmt tool to make the conf closer the App that needs it, and match the App lifecycle


Testing
- Using all the tooling and automation existing in Dev helps a lot


Stating / Production Deployment
- Treat it like an other App
- Multiple environment
- As close as they can be
