## On premise K8s Cluster

### 0 - Agenda

* What is k8s ?
* Why run / Not run k8s
* Why own cluster
* Building what public cloud provide



### 1 - What is k8s ?

* Node
* Pod
* Service
* Ingress (Bridge to access the service)



### 2 - Why run k8s ?

Shopify:
- Already using containers
- OWN containers mgmt, but lot of glue ...

-> OK


BUT
- Long running Jobs
- "Fixed" scheduling assomption workflow
- Stateful services

-> Maybe NOT



### 3 - Own cluster ?

Shopify:
- 2 DCs
- Cloud might NOT be competitive at scale
- Allow is to migrate stuff, 1 at a time, in a "cloud" way, without latency
- Lack of full automation and security



### 4 - Build what cloud offers

Components
- HA (masters)
- Ingress
- Storage


#### HA for K8s masters

- `ECMP` Anycast for requests to API server
- `etcd` is already clustered and provide the consistency


#### Ingress

ClusterIP / NodePort
-> Not really efficient

Implemented IngressController for Haproxy Outside of the Cluster


#### Storage

Complicated
