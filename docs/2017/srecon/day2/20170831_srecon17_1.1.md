## Deployment in age of MicroServices

### 0 - Agenda

1. Type of changes
2. Why changes
3. What can go wrong
4. Best practices
5. Naming



### 1 - Type of changes

various kind of changes
* Client
* Server
* Static config
* Dynamic config

And various time to recovery
* Minutes,
* Hours,
* Days,
* ...



### 2 - Why change ?

Reliabilty:

>
> "Safest thing to do is NOT CHANGE ANY THING !
>


On the contrary:

>
> A boat in an harbor is safe,
> But that's not what boat are built for
>

-> Not rewarding to not change anything
-> No new feature, no business development
-> No optiomizations
-> No evolutions
....



### 3 - What can go wrong ?

Lots of business relativ issues:
* Direct revenu loss
* User-confidence loss
* Pay-users complains
* ...



### 4 - Best practices

The optimal rollout is:
* Staged
* Progressive with metrics monitoring
* Revertable
* Transparent (No 1 man knowledge, no truk man, ...)
* Automtic
* Well understood by everyone


Detect badness as early as possible:
* High quality tests
* Build often
* A/B Testing
* Automate to reduce human errors
* "Hold back", make changes funel complete (locked from changes till the end of the release)
* Deploy often
* Make it easy to rollback
* Backward compatibility



### 5 - Naming

Consistant naming scheme:

Everybody needs to have the same word for the same thing
* Stages
* Actions
* App name


Examples
```
Server name
binary release
Machines
load-balancing
...
```
