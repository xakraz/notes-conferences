## One ring to rules them all


### 1 - Origin

Why Rollout automation are reinvented all the time ?

* Every SRE thinks that their service is "special" and no common things can work
* Every SRE are lazy, impatient and "Haris"
* Every SRE thinks he can solve the problem, quickly, as a little fix


Break the circle of :
-> short term project
-> More long term tech debt, hacks, incidents ...


The situation:
* SRE spends a non-trivial amount of time keeping rollout automation running ...
* Write "monolithc" and overly specific automation



### 2 - How to converge to a "standard" solution ?

Investment:
-> Implement a standard product


We already have a "standard" framework to write automation !

There is a difference between:
- standard framework
- Common product


1st principle
* Decompose monolithic automation in microservices

2nd
* Tests

3rd
* Unprivileged

-> Design for all services
-> validate with MVP



### 3 - Tech bits

Hosted and Shared
* Scheduler
* lock        (fined grained)
* Policies    (To prevent issues)
* Store       (Metadata)
* UI


Custom to the automated system
* Executor
* Other actions



### 4 - What's next / How to spread ?

How get support from all the managers ?


How get enough people work on this ?
- People who are interested do their best


How do you convince services to adopt ?
- People are heavily invested in their code
- Do not brag and say we will through up previous work


Requirements gathering is ESSENTIAL



### 5 - Hard things learned

* Requirement gathering is hard
* Rollout automation, everybody wants it, nobody has time to work on it
* Rollout isn't stand alone, lots of integration work
* Rollout are long, and we can not stop (in storage at least)
