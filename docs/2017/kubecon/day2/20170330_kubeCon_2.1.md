## 2 - Presentations

### 2.1 - CoreDNS

#### Intro

Was involved in `SkyDNS`
Using `etcd` as a backend

SkyDNS was 1 simple function wich did everything
-> Wanted to rework Skydns
-> Forked and started the `CoreDNS` thing


#### What is Service discovery ?

DNS protocol has a SRV record

`<SERVICE>._<PROTO>.domain.com. SRV priority weight port target.`


#### DNS protocol

DNS started as a simple protocol
* (very) old  RFCs
* Lots of RFCs that extended the protocol
* RFCs are not respected by everybody


#### CoreDNS Demo

Basics
* Reads ETCD records
* Translate as DNS records

Supports GRPC


#### Project / Issues

* Dig is your only friend
* DNS is old and not easy to use, debug, explore ...
* UDP for 512 Bytes max
  + Fallback to TCP
  + But oftenly blocked by FWs
  + MAX 64k bytes
  + After -> you are screwed


#### SkyDNS / CoreDNS

Mutli zones support in CoreDNS
