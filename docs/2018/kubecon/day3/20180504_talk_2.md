## What "production ready" does really mean ?

Note: This talk is focused on k8s layer, not provision, not app deployment



### 1 - Production ready def

Good *enought* for user to server real-world traffic

>
> Your offering is prod ready whent it exceed what your users expect
> - Google def

It is all about tradeoffs



### 2 - Prod ready factors

1. *Reasonable* secure (you can spend a lifetime trying to secure your cluster)
2. HA *enought* for the usage
3. Every components are *declaratively controlled*
4. Changes to the cluster state can be *safely* applied
5. Cluster pass e2e tests from CNCF



### 3 - HA

1. k8s components can fail without causing the cluster to fail
2. Mahines can fail without causing the cluster to fail



### 4 - Security

**TLS** communication everywhere
* Use anexternal PKI provider

API AuthN & AuthZ
* **Disable** anonymous auth on localhost
* Enforce **RBAC** and **NodeAuthorizers**

Kueblet lockdown
* Kueblet should have uniq ID
* Disable readonly, public and cAdvisor ports
-> Should be disabled in 1.11

Dashboard & Helm
* Whitelist explict operations for `tiler`
* Don't give `cluster-admin` to everyones
-> Has auth since 1.7



### 5 - Deny by default (sec Bestpractices)

Deny by default
* RBAC
* NetworkPolicy
* `restrictive` PodSecurityPoicy



### 6 - Kubeadm

HA with Kubeadm
* `kubeadm init` on each Master node + LB for API servers
* `kubeadm join` on each Worker node

Tips:
* Hosts admin and controlPlan resources on the masters nodes
* Use `Pod anti-affinity`
* Prometheus `kube-state-metrics`
* Define SLI, SLO and SLA



### 7 - ClusterAPI

Features:
* Upgrade
* Auto-repair
* Cluster autoscale



### Recap

* Pay attention to your need
* HA != MultiMaster
* PKI is important
* Declarative control is better
