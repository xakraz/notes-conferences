## K8s SIG: Cluster Lifecycle

Mission

>
> Change k8s to make it easier to Create and Operate
>


### Intro

What do we Do:
1. Control Plane Installation Management
  + Building `kubeadm`
  + Maintaining the doc

2.Control plane Config Management
  + Building a CP API
  + Componenent config Best practices

NEW:

3. Simplifying Infra Mgmt
  + Machine API + Cluster API

4. Add Management
  + WIP

5. ETCD Management
  + WIP



### Cluster API

Alpha state
\+ API specs have been written

API objects:
* Cluster: General cluster level config (Ex: Network)
* Machine: Host (VM or Physical), not yet a Node
* MachineSet / MachineDeployment

>
> Declarative way to create, configure and manage a cluster
>

-> Generic config interface for any tool (Kops, Aws, GKE, Terraform, ...)



### KubeADM

| Layer3 | Addons: Paas services (Monitoring, Logging, LBs / Ingress, ....)
|        | + ClusterAPI on top of k8s api server to manage the cluster     |
| Layer2 | Kubeadm: bootstrap a cluster (Machines are now qualified nodes) |
| Layer1 | Infra -> Machines |



### Takes away

Kuebadm
* Set of tasks as Best-practice cluster bootstrap
* Focus on user experience
* Linited scope: Building block
  + Deals with LocalFS + k8s API
  + Agnostic to `kubectl`
  + NOT favoring any CNI
* Composable: divided into Phases
  + you can use only 1 step of kubeadm if you don't want it to spawn a whole CP by its own



### Recent accomplishements

* Kubeadm 1.10 (Sync with k8s releases)
  + Advanced AUDITING
  + etcd 3.2
  + etcd TLS encryption
  + CoreDNS beta support
* Alpha ClusterAPI
* Integrated with Kops 1.9 and Kubespray



### One more thing: Kops

Opinonated way to build on AWS + GCE
* `kops create cluster CLUSTERNAME --options`
* `kops Update cluster CLUSTERNAME --options`

Kops roadmap
* Extract components for ClusterAPI and MachineAPI
* Extract addons-manager
* ETCD manager
