Migrating to k8s from the Finanicial Times



## 1 - Journey

Challenge is when you start with Existing services, and not starting from scratch

Why change ?
* Hand rolled Docker in Prod mid 2015
* Spend your innovation tokens wisely
* Estimated cost reduction: 80% of EC2

BUT
* Many fewer steps to start running a new service in Prod ...
* Doc challenge to know current running app
* Choose boting tech (Etsy blog post)

WARNING
* The FT is not a cluster operations teams
* Metrics for success:
  - Amount of time spent keeping cluster healthy



## 2 - Decisions

Be confortable with change, don't scare makine bad descision.
Nowadays we now how to measure fast failure to change the plan



## 3 - Migrating

Running train:
* Do things in parallel ... (2 stacks)

Notes:
* Branch vs if/else
  - Branch is very difficult to maintain
  - If/else: you deploy on your living stack stuff for the new stack ...
* Separate deployment mechanism / same tool
  - Same than branches ...

Warning:
* Doing things in parallel takes time and money



## 4 - CCL

* We did not start from the easier starting point
* We did not end where we thought

-> At some point ask your self if you are happy with the system and settle :)
