## K8s Multicluster without Fed

### Overview

#### Multi-clusters

* MultiCloud
* MultiRegion
* clusters / teams
* clusters / ....
* ...

Hard to maintain and manage


#### Federation

Idea:
* Federation API Server
* Above API servers
* ...

Issues ?
* Security
* Operations
  - FederationApiServer is a full controlplane
  - Need HA, but `etcd` accross wan is not recommanded

=> Complicated



### Break up the pb

#### Expectations

App Owner POV
* CI/CD for my App
* Cluster discovery
* Hope failover between clusters
* Credentials mgmt ?

Infra Admin POV
* Connect and track clusters
* Ensure overall security
* Lock down
* Resources Mgmt


/!\ about muti-tenant clusters
  -> BEWARE of resources exhaustion



#### Existing resources

Cluster Registry (Tectonic)
* `kubectl get clusters`

-> Is CRD
-> BUT Lives on 1 cluster, Need to mesh them ...


AccessControl
* Users
  - Apps Owners
  - Enginner
  - SRE
  - Bots
* Stages / Environment

-> Hard with policies



### Bring your own worflows

#### Usage expectations

Apps & Config: same concerns:
* CI / CD
* Deployment policy ?

Apps Owner:
* version
* Config & secrets

SRE
* RBACs



### Tectonic Multi-clusters

#### Based on

ClusterRegistry
* Sync to all clusters
* USe registry as selector for polyc

Sync Policy
* Agent running on cluster
* Focus on RBAC
* CRUD namespaces
* Updated immediately across clusters

```
kind: ClusterPolicy
```


#### Example

|     Cluster registry              |
| --------------------------------- |
| Regions1     | Region2  | Region3 |
| --------------------------------- |
| Prod | Stage | Prod     | Prod    |
| --------------------------------- |
|  Common Roles and Bindings        |


Better Security:
* No cluster need to access all clusters
* ServiceAccounts can be audited and revoked
* ServiceAccounts only ready Clusters and ClusterPolicy


#### More specialized software

Least complex
* Bash script
* Jenkins

More Complex
* Operatos
  ++ Specialized controller for an app
  ++ Model apps using CRDs
  ++ Use native k8s objetcs and concepts
  -- Requires k8s native app

Smarter
* Federationv2
  -- This is a vast problem space
  ++ Don't have to use all parts
  ++ Polices are modeled
  -> Implemented as Aggregated API
  -> Secured with ServiceAccounts
  -> Will be possible to write custom scheduler
